> You don't have to take our word on all of this. All apps are open source projects. Anyone can study the source code and make an informed decision.

### We do not run infrastructure

We do not run infrastructure or provide cloud services.

### Sensitive Permissions

Because some of our apps request the CAMERA, and/or GET_ACCOUNTS, and/or CONTACTS permissions, we [are required](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/113469#privacy) to provide this Privacy Policy.

#### Birthdays into Calendar / Birthdays into Calendar (Free) / Fix for Birthday Calendar
These apps request the GET_ACCOUNTS and READ_CONTACTS permissions to retrieve birthdays and other events from your contacts that are stored in Android's address book database.
These are then used to provide events for your calendar app **locally** on your device.
The events are created **offline** and never transmitted to online services or third-parties.

#### Calendar Import - Export (ics)
This app request the GET_ACCOUNTS permission to retrieve all accounts and account names that provide calendar events.
This is done **offline**. Account information is never transmitted to online services or third-parties.

#### Standalone Calendar
This app requests the GET_ACCOUNTS permission to provide a list of all calendar accounts inside the app.
This is done **offline**. Account information is never transmitted to online services or third-parties.
