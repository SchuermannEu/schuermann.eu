# Android Support
My apps are free, without ads.
I don't really make money from them.
Thus, I cannot provide support in my free time.
If you have any issues, please fill them on Github.

If you like to pay me for supporting you, contact me on [cotech.de](https://cotech.de/services/).

I support end-to-end encrypted emails.  
Keys are automatically exchanged via [Autocrypt](https://autocrypt.org) and available via [WKD](https://wiki.gnupg.org/WKD).  
Alternatively, you can [manually download the key](https://keys.openpgp.org/search?q=dominik%40schuermann.eu).  
You can also download my [OpenPGP Git Signing Key](https://keys.openpgp.org/search?q=9E287AEA392107A5BDEE15176411A09443B83D62) (not for communication).
