My research and work is influenced by my moral beliefs.
They are based on the [Cypherpunk's Manifesto](http://www.activism.net/cypherpunk/manifesto.html) (Eric Hughes, 1993) and modern critiques of our research field, such as [The Moral Character of Cryptographic Work](http://web.cs.ucdavis.edu/~rogaway/papers/moral.html) (Phillip Rogaway, 2015):

> "Cryptography rearranges power: it configures who can do what, from what.
> This makes cryptography an inherently political tool, and it confers on the field an intrinsically moral dimension.
>
> The Snowden revelations motivate a reassessment of the political and moral positioning of cryptography.
> They lead one to ask if our inability to effectively address mass surveillance constitutes a failure of our field.
> 
> I believe that it does. I call for a community-wide effort to develop more effective means to resist mass surveillance.
> I plead for a reinvention of our disciplinary culture to attend not only to puzzles and math, but, also, to the societal implications of our work."

# Research
My research interests focus on these topics:

*   Contextual Security for Device-to-Device Pairings based on Human Gait, Ambient Audio
*   End-to-End Encrypted Communication: API for NFC Cryptography, ZRTP Analysis, Usability of Key-Fingerprints
*   Security in Delay-Tolerant Networks: Forward Secure DTNs, ÂµDTNSec, RAIM: Redundant Array of Motes
*   Trustworthy Transportation Systems: Cooperative Charging, Trustworthy Parking Communities

I published over [15 papers on international conferences and journals]({{< ref "paper.md" >}}).
