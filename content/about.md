My research and work is influenced by my moral beliefs.
They are based on the [Cypherpunk's Manifesto](http://www.activism.net/cypherpunk/manifesto.html) (Eric Hughes, 1993) and modern critiques of our research field, such as [The Moral Character of Cryptographic Work](http://web.cs.ucdavis.edu/~rogaway/papers/moral.html) (Phillip Rogaway, 2015):

> "Cryptography rearranges power: it configures who can do what, from what.
> This makes cryptography an inherently political tool, and it confers on the field an intrinsically moral dimension.
>
> The Snowden revelations motivate a reassessment of the political and moral positioning of cryptography.
> They lead one to ask if our inability to effectively address mass surveillance constitutes a failure of our field.
> 
> I believe that it does. I call for a community-wide effort to develop more effective means to resist mass surveillance.
> I plead for a reinvention of our disciplinary culture to attend not only to puzzles and math, but, also, to the societal implications of our work."

# Research
My research interests focus on these topics:

*   Contextual Security for Device-to-Device Pairings based on Human Gait, Ambient Audio
*   End-to-End Encrypted Communication: API for NFC Cryptography, ZRTP Analysis, Usability of Key-Fingerprints
*   Security in Delay-Tolerant Networks: Forward Secure DTNs, ÂµDTNSec, RAIM: Redundant Array of Motes
*   Trustworthy Transportation Systems: Cooperative Charging, Trustworthy Parking Communities

I published over [15 papers on international conferences and journals]({{< ref "paper.md" >}}).

# Android

You can [support my work on Android projects via PayPal](https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_donations&business=android%40schuermann.eu&lc=US&item_name=Android+Donation&no_note=0&no_shipping=1&currency_code=EUR).

I actively maintain the following Android projects:

* [OpenKeychain](https://www.openkeychain.org)
* [Hardware Security SDK](https://hwsecurity.dev/)

Sometimes I contribute to these projects:

* [Etar Calendar](https://github.com/Etar-Group/Etar-Calendar)
* [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/)
* [K-9 Mail](https://k9mail.github.io/)

I am currently working on getting the features of Birthday Calendar, Calendar Import/Export and Offline Calendar into the Etar Calendar.
Then I will probably deprecate the old apps.

* [Birthday Calendar](https://github.com/SufficientlySecure/birthday-calendar)
* [Calendar Import/Export](https://github.com/SufficientlySecure/calendar-import-export)
* [Offline Calendar](https://github.com/SufficientlySecure/offline-calendar) (now part of Etar calendar)
* [Document Viewer](https://github.com/SufficientlySecure/document-viewer)

I started some apps where I am no longer actively participating in their development:

* FasterGPS
* NTPSync
* [AdAway](https://adaway.org/)

# Standards

I sometimes contribute to open standards, such as [Autocrypt](https://autocrypt.org).
